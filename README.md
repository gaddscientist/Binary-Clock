# Binary-Clock
A binary clock app written in java for Android

The app includes a digital clock for reference beneath the binary clock
and can be toggled on or off.

The binary clock can be displayed in 12 or 24 hour formats.

The clock is read with each set of two columns representing
the two digits in the hour, minute, or second(read HH:MM:SS).
The sets of columns are also color coded for easier reading.
